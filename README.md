# The E621 Downloader (TED)
e621dl made easy.


The E621 Downloader was created to make it easier to use e621dl by giving a more friendly UI and automatically creating the config file. TED has no malicious intent. I left it as a batch file so it can be edited and/or looked at for anyone curious or wanting to edit it.



# Installation and use:
- Install the latest version of Python (I used 3.7.4 for this version).

https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Download the zip file
- Extract wherever
- Run "The E621 Downloader.bat"

# Disclaimer
TED IS AN OPEN SOURCE PROGRAM FEEL FREE TO COPY, EDIT, AND DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO IT!

I do not own e621dl or claim to own it.

The copy of e621dl I used is created by Wulfre.
